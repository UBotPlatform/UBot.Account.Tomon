## About UBot
UBot is an open source platform for developing chat bots. It provides consistent apis for different platforms (telegram, discord and more!) in a language-independent way, making bot development WORA-able (Write once, Run anywhere).

## About Tomon
[Tomon](http://www.tomon.co/) is a Discord-like platform in China, aiming to provide a modern chat platform for ACG fans. This is a new and developing service, so [Bot API](https://developer.tomon.co/) is not very stable. When I started the project, tomon was still in the beta phase. You may meet problems when using Tomon and UBot.Account.Tomon, we will try our best to help you and Tomon to solve these problems.

## About UBot.Account.Tomon
This project is a Tomon backend for UBot Platform, making UBot Apps able to run on Tomon.
